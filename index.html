      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Irshad, a third-year BCA student with a passion for web development. I'm currently focused on mastering the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—under the guidance of Rohit Negi. My interest in technology began with a curiosity about how websites work, leading me to dive deeper into full-stack development.

        I enjoy creating responsive and user-friendly web applications, ensuring both the front-end and back-end work seamlessly together. I’m particularly fascinated by the dynamic nature of web technologies and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. My goal is to become a proficient developer capable of delivering high-quality solutions.
        
      In my free time, I love exploring new frameworks and best practices to keep up with the latest trends in web development. I’m excited to work on projects that challenge me and contribute to innovative web experiences.
